# SafeTogether
The social isolation measures necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic are making it more difficult for those who are at risk of abuse or violence to safely reach out for help. The Canadian Women's Foundation started the campaign, "Signal For Help", which establishes a single-handed gesture that can be used by an individual to alert others that they feel threatened or need help over a video stream or calls. SafeTogether is an application that monitors streams for the signal in attempt to protect individuals of domestic violence situations.
